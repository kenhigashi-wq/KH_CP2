3D Shooter (Ursina)

A minimal 3D shooting demo built with the Ursina game engine (Python).

Files:
- `main.py` — the game code (player, shoot, enemies, score)
- `requirements.txt` — lists `ursina`

Run (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Notes:
- Ursina opens a window. Use WASD + mouse to look/move, left-click to shoot.
- If you want sounds, models, or more features, I can add them next.
